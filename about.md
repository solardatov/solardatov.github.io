Hello, my name is Vladimir. I am Software Engineer and living in St. Petersburg, Russia. I was working for Motorola Solutions, Electronic Arts and now I am working for SAPRUN, leading russian company delivering SAP-based solutions, so here I am developing C++ connectivity and data storage framework for mobile platforms.

Except my work I like traveling as backpacker to try to see countries through the eyes of local residents.
